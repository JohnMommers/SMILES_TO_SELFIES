Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES): A 100% robust molecular string representation Mario Krenn, Florian Haese, AkshatKumar Nigam, Pascal Friederich, Alan Aspuru-Guzik Machine Learning: Science and Technology 1, 045024 (2020), extensive blog post January 2021. Major contributors since v1.0.0: Alston Lo and Seyone Chithrananda  

A main objective is to use SELFIES as direct input into machine learning models, in particular in generative models, for the generation of molecular graphs which are syntactically and semantically valid.
